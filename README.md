- 👋 Hi, I’m @pragmaticLearner

- 👀 My interests are in data analysis, data engineering and software engineering. I've already completed a few analysis projects on 'kaggle.com'
      and commited a first SQL project on database design in MySQL.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL with multiple libraries with Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook and MySQL. I've got a lot on my mind what I'd like to learn and develop however right now I'm 
      getting a solid foundation within the programming online community and getting comfortable with using what I've learnt so far, creating projects.
      
- 💞️ I'm open to a variety of projects within areas of interest or even ones that are interesting enough to keep engaged and learn more practices
