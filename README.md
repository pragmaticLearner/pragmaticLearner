- 👋 Hi, I’m @pragmaticLearner

- 👀 My interests are in data engineering with Python however I'm at a stage where I am branching out, experiementing and starting to be interested in 
other areas of tech.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently employed as a full time data engineer in FinTech using Python (PySpark, Airflow), AWS (with all services) and many other packages which are used in the industry to help achieve the solutions I need.
      
- 💞️ I'm open to a variety of projects within areas of interest or even ones that are interesting enough to keep engaged and learn more practices. I am a self taught programmer so my strength lies in practical learning.
